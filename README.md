# PokedexProject

My first programming project, a fan-made Pokemon game created during my study phase using jQuery and JS Technologies inspired by the original Pokedex. The gameplay involves guessing one of the four most famous starter Pokemon based on their silhouette. Players can choose from the available options to see if they guessed correctly in each round. Although I faced challenges during development, I learned valuable skills.
